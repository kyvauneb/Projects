# Hashing allows us to map data of any size to a fixed length
## That fixed length integer is called a hash value

# The <object>.__hash__() method returns the hash value of the object if it has one
# An object is hashable if it has a hash value (memory address) that doesn't change during it's lifetime
## Hashability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set member, because these data structures use the hash value internally
## Immutable built-in objects are hashable, mutable containers (dictionaries, lists, sets) are not
## Objects that are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default
## They will all compare unequal, unless compared against themself; hash value is derived from their id (objectâ€™s address as present in the memory)

# If a class does not define an __eq__ method it should not define a __hash__ operation either; if it defines __eq__ but not __hash__, its instances will not be usable as items in hashable collections.
# Immutability: 
## Changes made to MUTABLE referenced objects (ex. values2 = values when both are lists) are made to the same address location in memory
## For IMMUTABLE objects, after copying by reference, the memory address of both variables will be the same; but after changing ones value, they'll be different
## "is" comparison is used to check if objects have the same memory address/identity/id, "==" is used to check if they have the same values
## Exception: Though tuples are immutable, we can change the value of a list (or other mutable container) in the tuple
### When we talk about the mutability of a container only the **identities** of the contained objects are implied
